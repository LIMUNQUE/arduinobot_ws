# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a robot arm with an Raspberry pi 4, using artificial vision from opencv.
It will be able to classify objects by color and other characteristics in order to pick and drop them in the correct place.

In a close future we'll add micro-ros for improve communication between server and the microcontroller.

## Simulation Project
As shown in the previous project, once the classification system of the arm is achieved, it seeks a simulation and integration with the ROS software

For this project RVIZ will be use for visualize and gazebo for the simulation process.
